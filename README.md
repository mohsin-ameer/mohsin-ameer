As a UI/UX designer with 3 years of experience, I have developed a strong foundation in UI design principles, accessibility,
 wireframing and prototyping, UI animation,
as well as UX aspects such as user research, information architecture, emotional design, UX strategies, and UX psychology.
I have worked on many projects and solved many problems, which has helped me develop a good grip on these concepts.
